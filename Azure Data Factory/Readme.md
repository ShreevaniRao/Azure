### **What I Learned from ADF Pipelines**:

- Designing efficient pipelines for **complex workflows** using native Azure tools.
- Implementing **parameters and variables** for reusable, modular pipelines.
- Debugging pipelines and handling **error management** effectively.

## **How This Repository Reflects My Growth**

Through these projects, I enhanced my understanding of:

1. **End-to-End Workflows**: Combining ADF and Databricks for seamless integration.
2. **Orchestrating Pipelines**: Leveraging dependency settings, parameterization, and conditional logic.
3. **Streamlining Analytics**: Bridging data engineering pipelines with **real-time BI reporting**.
4. **Continuous Learning**: Adopting best practices for coding, pipeline design, and monitoring.
