## Project Overview 

This an end-to-end data engineering project using Azure cloud computing platform, which attempts the use case to build an end to end solution by ingesting the tables from on-premise SQL Server database using Azure Data Factory and then store the data in Azure Data Lake. Then Azure databricks is used to transform the RAW data to the most cleanest form of data and then using Azure Synapse Analytics to load the clean data to a Sql Serverless database and finally using Microsoft Power BI to integrate with Azure synapse analytics to build an interactive dashboard to derive & display the business insights. Also, we are using Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Azure Key Vault for the monitoring and governance purpose.

### Dataset

**AdventureWorks** is a sample database provided by Microsoft for free on online platforms. It is a product sample database originally published by Microsoft to demonstrate the supposed design of a SQL server database using SQL server 2008. Here are some key points to know about AdventureWorks:

- AdventureWorks database supports a manufacturing MNC named Adventure Works Cycles.
- It is a sample Online Transaction Processing (or OLTP) database, which is a type of data processing where multiple transactions occur concurrently. These are shipped by Microsoft with all of their SQL server products.

For this project I used the **Lightweight (LT) data**: a lightweight and pared down version of the OLTP sample. [Download here](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks/AdventureWorksLT2014.bak)

### Project Goals

- Connect on-premise SQL Server database to Azure cloud using SHIR - Self Hosting Integration Runtime.
- Ingest data as Parquet files into Azure Data Lake storage container using Azure Data Factory(ADF).
- Apply data cleaning and transformation logic using Pyspark & Python in Azure Databricks notebook.
- Utilize Azure Synapse Analytics to load transformed data into Delta files in Data Lake Storage container.
- Analyze and create interactive data visualizations and reports with Microsoft Power BI Desktop connecting to Azure Synapse Analytics serverless database.
- Implement Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Azure Key Vault for monitoring and governance.

## Project Architecture

Below diagram displays the design and details of the resource architecture :

### Setup Environment
- Create the Resource group.
- Create all the resources - ADF, Azure Databricks, Azure Key Vault, Data Lake Storage container & Azure Synapse Analytics in the resource group.
- Create the Data lake storage containers structure - brone, silver & gold to support the ETL data.

<a name="data-ingestion"></a>
### Data Ingestion
- Connected the on-premise SQL Server database with Azure using Microsoft Self Hosting Integration Runtime.

<a name="data-transformation"></a>
### Data Transformation
- Mounted Azure Blob Storage to Databricks to retrieve raw data from the Data Lake 'bronze' container.
- Used Spark Cluster in Azure Databricks to transform using Pyspark & Python with a Azure Databricks notebook.
- Saved the transformed data in a Delta format for data analysis to 'silver' storage container.

<a name="data-loading"></a>
### Data Loading
- Created Azure Synapse Analytics pipeline to orchestrate activities to execute a stored procedure to dynamically create views for each table in a Serverless SQL database(gold_db) using table names from the 'gold' data lake storage container.
- Created Linked Service to connect to the Azure Sql database to connect to the Stored procedure.

<a name="data-reporting"></a>
### Data Reporting
- Connected Microsoft Power BI to Azure Synapse, and used the Views of the DB to create interactive and insightful data visualizations.
